# Accounts and Permissions

## 1. Overview

An account identifies a participan in an ALAIO blockchain. An individual or group can be a participant depending on the assigned permissions inside the account. Accounts can also represent the smart contract actors that both push and receive actions to and from other accounts in the blockchain. Actions are always contained within transactions. A transactions can be one or more atomic actions.

Accounts that have permissions associated are used to authorize actions and transactions to other accounts. Every permission is connecteed to an authority table which holds a threshold that must be reached in order to allow the action associated with the given permission to be authorized for execution. The link below contains a diagram that illustrates the relationship between accounts, permissions, and authorities.

The example above depicts `alice`'s account, her named permissions along with their hierarchical dependencies, and her linked `active` authority table. It also shows that a weight threshold of two must be reached in `alice`'s `active` authority in order to allow an action associated with the active permission to be executed by or on behalf of `alice`.

## 2. Accounts

Each account is identified by a human readable name between 1 and 12 characters in length. The characters can include a-z, 1-5, and optional dots (.) except the last character. This allows exactly one exa (2^60) accounts minus one:

![accounts equations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alacrityio/alacrity-support-documentation/main/developer%20documentation/resources/Accounts_And_Permissions_equation.png)

which is in the order of 1Ã—10^18.

Ownership of each account on an ALAIO blockchain is solely determined by the account name. Therefore, an account can update its keys without having to redistribute them to other parties.

### 2.1. Account Schema

Other than the account name, the blockchain connects other fields with each account instance contained in the chain database. Examples of these fields are such as ram quota/usage, cpu/net limits/weights, voter info, etc. (see `account` schema below). On the more important side, each account contains the list of named permissiosn assigned to it.This allows a flexible permission structure that makes single or multi-user authorizations possible (see 3. Permissions).

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
account_name | name | encoded 13-char account name
head_block_num | uint32_t | last block account was referenced
head_block_time | time_point | last time account was referenced
privileged | bool | True, if privileged account, False otherwise
last_code_update | time_point | time account code was set/updated
created | time_point | time account was created
core_liquid_balance | asset | current balance of token asset
ram_quota | int64_t | maximum RAM amount for account
net_weight | int64_t | weight for net limit percentage (weight/total)
cpu_weight | int64_t | weight for cpu limit percentage (weight/total)
net_limit | account_resource_limit | total net used, available, and max
cpu_limit | account_resource_limit | total cpu used, available, and max
ram_usage | int64_t | amount of RAM in bytes used by account
permissions | array of permission | list of named permissions
total_resources | variant | total cpu/net weights for all accounts
self_delegated_bandwidth | variant | cpu/net stake delegated from self
refund_request | variant | cpu/net refund amounts for token unstaking
voter_info | variant | name of voter, proxy or producers, vote stake
rex_info | variant | vote stake and rex balance if applicable

The name type consists of a 64-bit value that encodes alphanumeric characters into 5-bit chunks, except the last character, if any, which uses a 4-bit chunk. The name type is used to encode account names, action names, etc. The time_point type stores timestamps in microseconds. The asset type associates a currency or token symbol with a given amount. The account_resource_limit type keeps track of the amount used, available, and maximum that can be used in a given window for the given resource (NET or CPU). The permission type holds the list of permission levels associated with the account (see 3. Permissions).



### 2.2. Actions and Transactions

Aside from identifying participants in the ALAIO blockchain, the other reason for accounts to exist are actions and transactions. Actions require one or more actions to push or send the actions, and a receiver account to whome the action is directed. When leaving proof, a receiver account is needed as well. In an action receipt the action was pushed to the intended receipient.

In comparison, transactions are skeptical to accounts, although there is an indirect link to them through their associated keys. Transactions are signed using one or more signing keys belonging to the one or more actors involved in the actions that form the transaction. This can be the receiving account itself or other authorized actors specified on the authority table from the receiving account's permission. 

## 3. Permissions

Permissions control what ALAIO accounts can do and how actions are authorized. This is accomplished through a flexible permission structure that links each account to a list of hierarchical named permissions, and each named permission to an authority table (see permission schema below).

Name | Type | Description
| --- | --- | --- |
perm_name | name | named permission
parent | name | parent's named permission
required_auth | authority | associated authority table

The parent field links the named permission level to its parent permission. This is what allows hierarchical permission levels in ALAIO.

### 3.1. Permission Levels

A named permission may be created under another permission, thereby allowing a hierarchical parent-children permission structure. This makes implicit action authorizations possible by allowing a given `actor:child-permission` authorization within an action to be implicitly satisfied if the `actor:parent-permission` is also satisfied. An authorization quorum or "threshold" must still be met for the action to be authorized for execution (see [3.2.2. Authority Threshold](#3.2.2.-Authority-Threshold)).

> Contract-level Permissions <br> <br> It is also possible to create an implicit link between two accounts with the same named permission (for authorization satisfaction purposes). This can be achieved by associating an explicit named permission to the smart contract (different from the "minimum permission" for that `contract[::action]`). However, defining explicit `actor:permission` authorizations within actions is preferred versus associating permissions to the whole contract.

Every account has two default named permissions when created, owner and active. They have a parent-child relationship by default, although this can be customized by adding other permission levels and hierarchies.

#### 3.1.1. Owner permission

At the root of the permission hierarchy for each account sits the owner permission. This makes it the highest relative permission an account can have in its permission structure. While the owner permission can do anything a lower level permission can do, it is usually used for the purpose of recovery when a lower permission have been compromised. As such, keys associated with the owner permission are typically kept in cold storage and not used for signing regular operations.

#### 3.1.2. Active permission

Currently in the ALAIO implementation, the implicit default permission linked to all actions is `active`, it sits one level below the `owner` permission within the hierarchy structure. the result is the `active` permission can do anything the `owner` permission has the ability to, except changing the keys associated with the owner. The `active` permission is typically used for voting, transferring funds, and other account operations. For the more specific actions, custom permissions are typically created below the `active` permission and mapped to specific contracts or actions. Refer to the Creating and Linking Custom Permissions for more details.

> Custom Permissions <br> <br> ALAIO allows to create custom hierarchical permissions that stem from the owner permission. This allows finer control over action authorizations. It also strengthens security in case the active permission gets compromised.

### 3.2. Authority Table

Every accounts permission has the ability to be linked to an authority table used to decide where a given action authorization can be satiated. The authority table contains the applicable permission name and threshold, the "factors" and their weights, all of which are used in the evaluation to determine whether the authorization can be satisfied. The permission threshold is the target numerical value that must be reached to satisfy the action authorization (see authority schema below).

#### authority schema

Name| Type| Description
--- | --- | ---
`threshold`| `uint32_t`| threshold value to satisfy authorization
`keys`| array of `key_weight`| list of public keys and weights
`accounts`| array of `permission_level_weight`| list of `account@permission` levels and weights
`waits`| array of `wait_weight`| list of time waits and weights

The `key_weight` type contains the actor's public key and associated weight. The `permission_level_weight` type consists of the actor's `account@permission` level and associated weight. The `wait_weight` contains the time wait and associated weight (used to satisfy action authorizations in delayed user transactions (see [Transactions Protocol: 3.6.3. Delayed User Transactions]()). All of these types allow to define lists of authority factors that are used for satisfaction of action authorizations (see [3.2.1. Authority factors below]()).

#### 3.2.1. Authority Factors

Every authority table linked to a given permission lists potential "factors" explicitly used in the evaluation of the action authorization. A factor type can be one of the following:

* Actor's account name and permission level
* Actor's public key
* Time wait

Specified by either public key or account name in the authority table are the potential actors who may execute the action. Time waits are unique elements which are satiated by publishing a transaction with a delay in excess of the defined time. These carry weights as well that may contribute to satisfy the threshold.

#### 3.2.2. Authority Threshold

Authorization over a given action is determined by satisfying all explicit authorizations specified in the action instance (see [Transactions Protocol: 3.4.3. Action Instance]()). Those are in turn individually satisfied by evaluating each "factor" (account, public key, wait) for satisfaction (potentially recursively) and summing the weights of those that are satisfied. If the sum equals or exceeds the weight threshold, the action is authorized.

#### 3.2.3. Authority Example

Shown below is the authority table for alice's publish named permission. In accordance to its contents, in order to authoritize an action under that permission, a threshold of two are required to be reached. Since both bob@active and stacy@active factors have a weight of two, either one can satisfy the action authorization. This means that either bob or stacy with a permission level of active or higher can independently execute any action under alice's publish permission.

Permission | Account / Public Key | Weight | Threshold
--- | --- | --- | ---
publish | bob@active | 2 | 2
<br> | stacy@active | 2
<br> | ALA7Hnv4iBfcw2... | 1
<br> | ALA3Wo1p9er7fh... | 1

Alternatively, it would require two acounts with public keys `ALA7Hnv4iBfcw2...` and `ALA3Wo1p9er7fh...` to satisfy the action authorization. This is because each public key has a weight of 1 in the authority table.

### 3.3. Permission Mapping

Any and all accounts can define a mapping between any of its named permissions and a smart contract or action within that contract. This defines the "minimum permission" required for that `contract[::action]`. However, it does not afford any other account any access or authority to execute that `contract[::action]`. This isby design and the process is controlled by a permission evaluation mechanism, described next. 

### 3.4. Permission Evaluation

Before an action is authorized to be executed, the ALAIO software must first check whether the signatures provided in the transactions are valid (see [3.4.2. Signature Validation]()). It then proceeds to check all of the actions authorizations included in the transaction. This is where permissions are evaluated. If there is at least one action that fails to be authorized (by not meeting the authority threshold (see [3.2.2. Authority Threshold]()), the transaction fails.

#### 3.4.1. Custom Permissions

By default every account on the ALAIO blockchain is linked to the `active` permission. Again, this can be customized by creating children permissions under `active` or by creating alternate permissions under owner (see [3.1. Permission Levels](#-3.1.-Permission-Levels)). Creating custom permissions under owner (separate from `active`) is recommended. This is because if the keys associated with the `active` permission are compromised, the security of the account will not be compromised.

> Use Case: Social Media <br> <br> Say we have a publish permission created for message posting on a social media application. However, we do not want to associate that permission with sensitive actions, such as transferring or withdrawing funds. Under this scenario, it makes sense to link the social::post action to the publish permission. This allows to define an authority structure which can authorize post, but cannot satisfy the default active permission for all other actions. That authority structure could delegate itself to a different account at any named permission level. If it did so to another publish permission on another account, that would be purely coincidental.

#### 3.4.2. Signature Validation

Satisfying authorities linked to permissions involves first and foremost the validation/recovery of the public keys that signed the transaction. After a signed transaction is received by a node, the set of signatures is extracted from the transaction instance. The set of public keys are then recovered from the signatures. Then for all actions included in the transaction, the node checks that each `actor:permission` meets or exceeds the minimum permission as defined by the per-account permission links.

Once validated, the set of recovered keys are provided to the authorization manager instance along with the amount of time "waited". The authorization manager then proceeds to check whether the provided "factors" satisfy the authorities, potentially recursing into other linked permission levels/authorities (see [3.2. Authority](#3.2.-Authority-Table) Table and [Transactions Protocol: 3.4. Verify Transaction]() for more information).
