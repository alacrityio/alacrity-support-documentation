# Try ALAIO in your browser

There are alternatives if you don't want to install `ALAIO` binaries on you local machine. If you have other types of restrictions installing `ALAIO` binaries you can try `ALAIO` in a web browser. This approach is powered by Gitpod.io and Docker. It provides developers with a personal single-node  `ALAIO` blockchain for development and testing purposes running in Gitpod.io's cloud accessible from your web browser.

You can give it a try in a matter of seconds [right now](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/ALAIO/alaio-web-ide) and you can read more details about it [on the alaio-web-ide project page](https://github.com/ALAIO/alaio-web-ide).

## ALAIO Testnet

You can experiment on the ALAIO Testnet with the most recent stable release of the ALAIO software. To start testing, you can register for an ALAIO Developer Account where you are able to deploy your smart contracts, push actions, inspect your transactions and much more from an easy to use web interface.
