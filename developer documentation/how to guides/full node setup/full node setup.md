# ALAIO Software Installation

There are a multitude of ways to install and use the ALAIO software:

* [Install ALAIO Prebuilt Binaries](00_install-prebuilt-binaries.md)
* [Build ALAIO from Source](01_build-from-source/index.md)

> If you are not experience with ALAIO, we recommend that you install the [ALAIO Prebuilt Binaries](00_install-prebuilt-binaries.md), then go to the [Getting Started](https://developers.ala.io/alaio-home/docs/) section of the [ALAIO Developer Portal](https://developers.ala.io/). If you are an adept developer, have no binaries available for your platform, or a block producer, you may need to [Build ALAIO from source](01_build-from-source/index.md) instead.

## Supported Operating Systems

ALAIO currently supports the following operating systems:

1. Amazon Linux 2
2. CentOS 7
3. Ubuntu 16.04
4. Ubuntu 18.04
5. MacOS 10.14 (Mojave)

> NOTE: It may be possible to install ALAIO on other Unix-based operating systems. This is not officially supported, though.
